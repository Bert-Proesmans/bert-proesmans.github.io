# I'm a fan of Kiara Takanashi!

This post is a continuation of my series about [Kiara Takanashi](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Takanashi_Kiara). The [first part](@/2021-05-12-Thank-you-Kiara.md) contained some vague and unfocused amalgamation of my latest 'obsession' and opinion about the topic itself. <!-- more -->
The wording is stiff, and its content indicates that I've merely seen a glimpse of the magical world of true fandom. I hope to do better this time and write a piece that holds the attention of future readers. Reality and probability theory says I should practice a lot more, though.

Let's attempt to dissect the more hidden in plain sight parts about being a true fan. Oh, and the gushing started with the previous installment overflowed into this one! Sorry, not sorry in advance.

## Fans and their trigger

Right off the bat, I'll come out and say that I have no clue how an average person converts into a fan. The practical circumstance is highly individualistic. But it might be fruitful to philosophize about why it's important to uncover the origin of the behavior.

Humans look for points of origin to contextualize the present. Even if we're talking about constantly changing processes, like a meandering riverbank, it's required information for either acceleration, deceleration, or prevention of the phenomenon.  
Uncovering the source itself is often a tedious and longwinded process. Depending on the topic, this process could save lives; A meandering river will pull itself straight over time, potentially flooding houses and acres. If we intend to intervene, the original river trajectory will guide us in reversing the corrosion. Or allow us to optimize the water flow to minimize the corrosion effects.

For me, reasons for getting into something boil follow below. I'm sure others will have different items or a larger enumeration.  
1. Weak affiliation.
1. Active effort to understand.

The first is a general reason that's better known as "I just rolled with it". Some people, sometimes, have no reason other than being at the right place and time. This was the case for almost all decisions I made in the past, and I simply rolled into the consequences they caused. I think opinions vary widely about why you'd want this reason on your list or not.

The second is me quasi telling myself that I'm "diving in". Contrary to the previous item, this didn't happen that many times (yet). I'm very particular about the topics that fall into this category. Those topics generally claim my entire free time for a maximum duration of a year. Then the topic lingers at the back of my mind until I forget about it.  
This is not a runbook of how I always experience stuff in life but an approximation that I feel comfortable writing down for eternity.

Now about Hololive, and consequentially Kiara. There was a weak affiliation because a friend was already a fan. It's because of my friend that I experienced the VTuber phenomenon for myself. Clips of Hololive streams are easily accessible, and [the interview with Calliope on the Thrash Taste podcast](https://youtu.be/tIU0xG-lXkQ) provided me with a plan to approach my dive into the topic. I followed Calliope's advice to watch the debut streams.

> The Youtube video linked above is an ok introduction to the VTuber topic. The three guys hosting the podcast each have a different opinion and experience going into the specific episode. Their questions and expectations get answers. Viewers from various backgrounds can relate better that way. Listen specifically to Connor if you feel like most words on this page seem alien to you.

## Fans and their hook

I didn't like the Hololive EN debut videos and felt like I was not part of the intended target audience. It left a bad taste. Out of the five talents, Calliope and Gura were interesting. Eventually, my interest waned.

I started actively searching for information on the physical personas. I created a hook on my own.

> Remember that I explicitly stated in the first post not to look for that information? You'll find this info with an effortless search, but keep in mind that the physical and virtual persona are explicitly separated. Uncovering this link goes against the wishes of the talents and makes the action disrespectful.

As it turns out, I was spoiled many times before but not clever enough to link the dots together. A more realistic explanation would be that I didn't care at that point.    
But when I eventually did care, this nugget of information changed my experience completely. The talents are amazing people! I felt a lot of respect, and Kiara's experiences specifically intrigued me very much. I wanted to know her story and understand her motivations. I became a serious fan of Kiara!

In practice, I'm part of the 'Kiara the phoenix fan club'. Kiara sounds genuine in her interactions, and I like her. I pushed her physical side to the very back of my mind, but I cannot deny that it helped me accept her virtual avatar as a regularity.  
There is a lot more I'd like to say about her, but I'm having trouble finding the right words. It remains a sensitive topic that I don't want to popularize. I don't regret what I did while she's also happy with the outcome.

> In a professional setting, people generally prefer online video meetings over a phone call. During a phone call, our eyes are providing unrelated information that lowers our focus and engagement. To counteract, we subconsciously project the person's face image on our brain, but only if we've already seen it. It's like an urge where some people can handle it better than others do.

I learned from this history that I used different angles to approach the topic. As if a puzzle presented itself with a lot of open space left to connect new pieces. That puzzle is hard to solve, and it took time to find the right spot to fit myself in.  
The topic boundaries also changed over time after I stripped more and more uninteresting parts. The reason why I'm a fan today isn't the same from day 0.

1. Looking into Hololive because of a friend
    * Hearing good things from people close to me sparks interest
1. Looking into VTubers because it's new
    * I'm always interested in understanding boundary-pushing events
1. Looking into VTuber talents individually
    * These virtual avatars come with pretty unique personalities
1. Looking into 'backstory'
1. Falling in 'love' with Kiara

The word 'love' is special to me, an expression strictly used for romantic love. I wouldn't say that out loud willy-nilly. But it's written out regardless, and the reason was a challenge for me to figure out. After all, this is the crux of this series of posts. Every struggle up to this point has been an effort to put this feeling into proper context.  
I understand that my strict definition of love breaks down. Not because of logic, but feelings. Nothing more incomprehensible to me than feelings, even if they are my own. Feelings are one example of life's aspects that you accept as is. Logic and reason fail to describe this thing. Talking to others about feelings revealed that they have an easier time accepting than me. I effectively struggle with acceptance at face value.

As a rule, there is no understanding of feelings, not your own and not from others. There exists no logical explanation, not always. On top of that, they create external reliances.  
People accept that without even understanding the consequences and then spread the idiom "Create your happiness". I find that idiom given the above very short-sighted. Either they don't completly understand what they're talking about or I'm not communicating on the same wavelength. Taking in a pet, for example, does not create your own happiness. You rely on the pet to be the source of happiness. Think about what happens when the pet is no more, you're worse of than before. I cannot accept that.

I'm well aware this makes me sound broken, or immature at the least. If I write this all down, why do I keep living such a sour sounding life?  
It's a choice I made for myself, with only one rule to adhere to; Don't regret afterwards. This choice works for me.  
I believe there are others making this choice too, but only the ones that don't complain about circumstance. That's a tangent I might write out in another post.

Now we reached the point where the title of this series falls into place. My journey into fandom lead to a full 180 degrees turn on my common approach to life, it's hypocritical. Being a sour person doesn't mean I'm not open to being proven wrong, in fact I love a good discussion. Sadly this experience ended up being a discussion with myself, but it bore fruit nonetheless.  
It's because of Kiara, she's a very special person. I think of her like my polar opposite, even though I don't know her in reality. She might not even fit this description, but that's what she became in my head. A test subject in improper wording.  
She tugged on my feelings, that's all she did... or I did to myself. In any case, the proper thing to do is thank her. At this point I should explicitly mention that loving Kiara means, to me, the same as being a serious fan. In any case she's a part of my life now and that won't change in the near future.

My perspective on life changed a bit, I feel smarter than yesterday. That doesn't mean I became a changed person, but it sure as hell indicates my personality won't be the same a few years from today.

## Fans and their future
