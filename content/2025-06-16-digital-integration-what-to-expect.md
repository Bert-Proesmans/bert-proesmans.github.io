Our society is built upon computers managing the intricacies of daily life; A stable power grid, clean water supply and payment transactions all depend on some computer dilligently processing information and taking necessary action. How do we harness this computing power to assist with tasks in our daily life, or small business?

# Powerful

Right now the outside temperature is 30 Â°C and inside my workspace I have access to everything except climate control. Today's plans turned into lazing around, but doing nothing quickly became boring. So here I am enjoying some computer time while writing this blogpost, this is the easy life! Too easy thanks to my needs being fulfilled by other computers that never stroke from heat and calculate their bits and bytes without any prospective of gratitude.

Computers have a lot of, if not most, control over the quality of my life. And over yours too, dear reader! Their impact potential puts them in a position of power, altough that position is often outside of plain sight.  
Jumping over the economics and other non-technical dynamics, the power in posession of the operators of those computers increases by serving more people, when the computers can *do more*. And to do anything new or different or simply more, the computers must become more powerful!

With the recent technological milestone that is ChatGPT, computers can handle a lot of different tasks! From the perspective of a person living in 2000 every personal computer today produces magical outputs. I'm talking about seemingly straightforward expectations like instant payment transactions, conversing with humans, continuously tracking your whereabouts and listening in on conversations with your friends and actually understanding your dark humor inside jokes.  
That last example is a bit creepy and confrontational, but it's telling how powerful todays computers are right this moment! Even the portable pocket-sized ones.  
So how do you wield this powerful machine for your own good, even on matters of personal scale?

# Data

The inner workings of a computer are simple to explain; Give data to the computer, explain how to interpret the data and explain the computer must do (think calculate) with the data. The output of that process, very likely more data, can be used as input to and use it as input to the next repeat this process again and again . That's the entire recipe for a computer program!  
Let's take the pesky details and pass them along to the people who studied computer science courses. But one of the steps is explaining to the computer 



# Integration
