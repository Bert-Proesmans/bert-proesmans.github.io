This post is a short response to [Why I prefer making useless stuff](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/makinguselessstuff.html) by Austin Henley.
This guy builds! A hacker in pure form.

Many words in use today are merely a ghost of what they originally entitled. "Purpose" is the example I tackle in this post. Politics and hacker are another, but I'll leave that can of worms for another time. That change of definition didn't happen auto-magically.

I present human perverseness. It's infectious and stems from a sad place. It's part of our core we can call upon anytime. That isn't a bad thing. Like with all things, too much of it creates a bad time. The examples from the linked blog article aren't very persuasive, in my opinion, but the sentiment does indeed exist.

We humans, as a species, are around since two million years ago (given Homo Habilis). We still struggle to understand each other. How and when will we turn this around?  
This plea isn't about race or skin color but people living a street away from each other.

Not everything we do needs to feed external validation back to us. Not money, no certificates, no praises. Sometimes work is done for oneself. Go clean your kitchen cabinets, and I'll tell you it was a waste of your time. How does that feel?  
That's not to say it isn't nice to get external validation. That can be a good motivator when the work gets tricky. Just don't assume your standards of worth apply to everyone.
