I'm pretty satisfied with my current smartphone. But "current" is too much of a stretch, so now I'm looking for a replacement.
<!-- more -->

I have a Oneplus X (Oneplus is the brand, X is the model) phone, you might or might not have heard of it. For reasons unknown to me, Oneplus decided to simply not mention that model ever again. It isn't there in public marketing material, and it isn't listed as a refurbish option. Only a bare minimum ["support" page remains](https://www.oneplus.com/support/spec/oneplus-x).  

# Stars aligned

This specific phone was actually my first smartphone. An opportunity arose at launch, checks wikipedia, around November 2015! Woah, that's already 6 years ago at the time of writing. It was actually a full package, this smartphone was perfect;

* About 5 inch screen, full phone height at 14cm. This is a NORMAL SIZED phone, ideal for single handed control and fits in any jeans pocket
* Snapdragon 801. A medium-high chipset at the time, "last-gen flagship" POG!
* 16GB internal memory
* Gyroscope-, acceleration-, GPS/GLONASS/BDS sensors. Some phones lacked (some of) those sensors, can you imagine?
* Radio. Nice to have
* (EU version) Almost all bands for EDGE, 2G, 3G, 4G standards sets. SO I COULD TAKE IT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
* Dual SIM slot. Super useful to combine work and personal SIM
* Expandable storage (at second SIM slot) up to 128GB by MicroSD
* Bluetooth 4. But who knows if it actually support Bluetooth Low Energy? I hoped it did.
* 1080p OLED screen with Corning glass front. WOAH BABY!
* Glass back. Nice to have, looks sleek, but invisible when encased.
* Textured aluminum bezel. Yes baby, that fricking nice
* ACTUAL BUTTONS; On/Off, Volume up/down
* Capacitive, programmable buttons; back, home, task switcher
* ALERT SLIDER. Yes.
* Single speaker, 3mm audiojack
* Micro-USB
* Single camera at the back with white flash, 13MP
* Single camera in the front, 8MP
* 2500 mAh battery. Not the greatest, could be worse (IPhones had <2000mAh)
* All the Audio Codecs!
* All the Video Codecs (including hardware decoding)!

For the people who aren't technically inclined; this is pretty much feature complete, at least for 2015. This means that you cannot really take anything away without impacting user experience.  
This smartphone cost me, checks expenses of 2015, 294 euro's including delivery. That's not a lot of bread/potatos/chungus for the stuff you get! But even still, I agonized over this purchase decision a lot. Around that time I was about to turn 21 years old and never needed a smartphone before. But at the same time this was an offer too good to ignore.

# WHY?

To understand why this was such a great deal I'll have to make comparisons with flagship phones of that time. Beware, this post will end with a rant! It basically wouldn't become a post if there wasn't a rant, that's how my motivation works.

Holiday season of 2015, the era of IPhone 6S ($649), Galaxy Note 5($696), Galaxy S6($699), Nexus 6P($499). NFC is a thing, Wifi AC is a thing, USB-C ports are installed, and fingerprint sensors are there too! The 3mm audio jack still exists and camera modules are limited to 1 per phone, and flashes became dual-toned.
Some flagship models release with an XL variant, increasing height of the phones with up to 2cm. The IPhones stay relatively small in size though!

Less visible changes were lack of dual-SIM modules, almost no OLED screens but LCD, removal of physical buttons, removal of removable storage modules. Optical image stabilization was in a weird spot, where some flagships removed it? Some phones experimented with stereo speakers.

# Now what?
