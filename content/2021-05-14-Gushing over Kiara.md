# I'm a fan of Kiara Takanashi!

This post is a continuation of my series about [Kiara Takanashi](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Takanashi_Kiara). The [first part](@/content/2021-05-12-Thank you Kiara.md) contained some vague and unfocused amalgamation of my latest 'obsession' and my opinion about the topic itself. <!-- more -->
The wording is stiff, and its content indicates that I've merely seen a glimpse of the magical world of true fandom. I hope to do better this time and write a piece that holds the attention of future readers. Reality and probability theory says I should practice a lot more, though.

Let's attempt to dissect the more hidden in plain sight parts about being a true fan. Oh, and the gushing started with the previous installment overflowed into this one! Sorry, not sorry in advance.

## Fans and their trigger

Right off the bat, I'll come out and say that I have no clue how an average person converts into a fan. The practical circumstance is highly individualistic. But it might be fruitful to philosophize about why it's important to uncover the origin of the behavior.

Humans look for points of origin to contextualize the present. Even if we're talking about constantly changing processes, like a meandering riverbank, it's required information for either acceleration, deceleration, or prevention of the phenomenon.  
Uncovering the source itself is often a tedious and longwinded process. Depending on the topic, this process could save lives; A meandering river will pull itself straight over time, potentially flooding houses and acres. If we intend to intervene, the original river trajectory will guide us in reversing the corrosion. Or allow us to optimize the water flow to minimize the corrosion effects.

For me, reasons for getting into something boil follow below. I'm sure others will have different items or a larger enumeration.  
1. Weak affiliation.
1. Active effort to understand.

The first is a general reason that's better known as "I just rolled with it". Some people, sometimes, have no reason other than being at the right place and time. This was the case for almost all decisions I made in the past, and I simply rolled into the consequences they caused. I think opinions vary widely about why you'd want this reason on your list or not.

The second is me quasi telling myself that I'm "diving in". Contrary to the previous item, this didn't happen that many times (yet). I'm very particular about the topics that fall into this category. Those topics generally claim my entire free time for a maximum duration of a year. Then the topic lingers at the back of my mind until I forget about it.  
This is not a runbook of how I always experience stuff in life but an approximation that I feel comfortable writing down for eternity.

Now about Hololive, and consequentially Kiara. There was a weak affiliation because a friend was already a fan. It's because of my friend that I experienced the VTuber phenomenon for myself. Clips of Hololive streams are easily accessible, and [the interview with Calliope on the Thrash Taste podcast](https://youtu.be/tIU0xG-lXkQ) provided me with a plan to approach my dive into the topic. I followed Calliope's advice to watch the debut streams.

> The Youtube video linked above is an ok introduction to the VTuber topic. The three guys hosting the podcast each have a different opinion and experience going into the specific episode. Their questions and expectations get answers. Viewers from various backgrounds can relate better that way. Listen specifically to Connor if you feel like most words on this page seem alien to you.

## Fans and their hook

I didn't like the Hololive EN debut videos and felt like I was not part of the intended target audience. It left a bad taste. Out of the five talents, Calliope and Gura were interesting. Eventually, my interest waned.

I started actively searching for information on the physical personas. I created a hook on my own.

> Remember that I explicitly stated in the first post not to look for that information? You'll find this info with an effortless search, but keep in mind that the physical and virtual persona are explicitly separated. Uncovering this link goes against the wishes of the talents and makes the action disrespectful.

As it turns out, I was spoiled many times before but not clever enough to link the dots together. A more realistic explanation would be that I didn't care at that point.    
But when I eventually did care, this nugget of information changed my experience completely. The talents are amazing people! I felt a lot of respect, and Kiara's experiences specifically intrigued me very much. I wanted to know her story and understand her motivations. I became a serious fan of Kiara!

In practice, I'm part of the 'Kiara the phoenix fan club'. Kiara sounds genuine in her interactions, and I like her. I pushed her physical side to the very back of my mind, but I cannot deny that it helped me accept her virtual avatar as a regularity.  
There is a lot more I'd like to say about her, but I'm having trouble finding the right words. It remains a sensitive topic that I don't want to popularize. I don't regret what I did while she's also happy with the outcome.

> In a professional setting, people generally prefer online video meetings over a phone call. During a phone call, our eyes are providing unrelated information that lowers our focus and engagement. To counteract, we subconsciously project the person's face image on our brain, but only if we've already seen it. It's like an urge where some people can handle it better than others do.

## Fans and their future

Coming soon!
