Who **is** Bert-Proesmans?!

TLDR; I'm a computer guy. The actual answer consists of more words, but I try to keep it light.

### Quickies

* My name is Bert Proesmans, no surprise there,

* Lives in Belgium,

* Loves to program (random) stuff,

* Occasionally wastes a lot of energy thinking long and hard about dilemmas and the [Golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)) in nature and man-made constructs.

* Online aliases: [Bert-Proesmans](https://github.com/Bert-Proesmans), BertP

### Long answer

Without going too far back into the events that made me who I am today, the period where I built out the biggest part of my personality was between age 17 and age 20. I'll always look back at this timespan as getting #woke (old meme by now, I know). To properly contextualize me at the start of this period of my life;

1. I've had the luxury of smart and caring parents (thanks mom and dad!) and close family,
2. I was supported, and encouraged to take on any challenge on my path,
3. For a long time I've lived kind of selfishly, not caring about other people and their feelings,
4. What is a setback, I've never encountered that before?

In those three years since age 17, I failed to successfully transition to the next year of high school. I had a one-year do-over, which was certainly painful for a while. In hindsight, this wasn't that bad because **I felt the importance of a good understanding of basic education**.. and **made more friends** on the way. I got my degree one year late.

I started university, where I quickly realized that **flukes are not a normal thing**. There were certainly walls I ran into but being surrounded by smarter people made me push myself to climb them. This wasn't always a solo effort, and I thank every one of my teammates for their rigor. I learned that **respect for each other is a basic necessity** because without it no type of relationship lasts... especially when those people have not perfectly aligned values. To this day I still **prefer being surrounded by smarter people**!  
There were also sad moments; people falling off or losing interest. It felt like my year do-over but worse because now I was the guy progressing on our trajectory and others were stumbling.

Years in a university are short, you meet new people and never see them again very quickly. Other than that you're forced to do your own time-management, decide your own workload, and _develop yourself_. This is a period where I was privileged to float in between responsibilities without consequences.  
And **I enjoyed this responsibility-free life very much**, even though it was partly detrimental to my being. A summary would be; _I got fat behind my computer_.  
It was a fun time, I look back to all of my school days with joy. I understood very well how luxurious that time was, and now it's hard to rehab from that way of living.

I tried to put a part of me into the above text, but I doubt it communicates well enough. I do remember taking a personality test in 2020 which, in my opinion, should better transcribe my reasoning. Apparently, personality changes over time, so the link is date stamped for reference, see below.

### Education

I've always been studying sciences on top of basic mathematics and language skills. I'm fairly confident in my Dutch and English, but my French and German are at a below-average level.  
At university, I chose Computer Science to prepare for a potential career in software/hardware development or any of their derivations. One of the most surprising things I learned is that all science domains cross-pollinate, so my science background proved useful.
I've had the pleasure to work with passionate people who taught me advanced topics in their respective fields. Outside of school, over the internet by example, I managed to pick up interesting bits of knowledge through the same means.

Important to note is that I didn't finish any higher degree. To quit school and start working is actually one of the few actively deliberate choices I made in my life.  
I certainly don't regret that decision, other than that there isn't much else to mention.

### Programming projects

My personal programming activity is tracked by Github and publicly available. My professional coding is conducted within private employer boundaries.  
Some highlights below;

* Protobuffer decompiler [C#] - open source @[HearthSim community](https://hearthsim.info/)  
    Decompiles specific protobuffer schema's from binaries

* Private servers and protocol investigation tools - closed source @[HearthSim community](https://hearthsim.info/)  
    HearthStone related stuff.

* Shift scheduler [Java-Python] - closed source @university  
    Project built with the purpose of properly planning coding efforts and cooperating with team members (6 people).  
    The end product is a platform comprised of 2 systems, built to be usable by youth movements, student clubs and businesses;
    
    1. Website for managing associated people, their shift schedules, availability, preferences and customizable weights to tune
    the scheduler,
    
    2. Back-end system generating schedules which measure up to the expectations of as many associated people within provided 
    constraints

* Wire connection overview - closed source @[Europower Generators bv](https://www.europowergenerators.com)  
    A Solidworks Electrical drawing data processor that outputs wire connections in a table. The order and direction of wires is optimized to simplify production preparations (eg wire cutting in bulk) and the actual connecting work.  
    Output is used in tandem with Single-line diagrams.

* Robot simulator [Java] - closed source @university  
    A project built with the purpose of properly planning coding efforts and cooperating with team members (2 people).  
    The end product is a (2D, top-down) visual simulator of robots interacting with their environment. The robots were
    programmable by writing Lua and interacting with our exposed API.
