I've had this one thing on my mind for a year now; Write stories around Calliope Mori. Looking back on on the last year, I did just that on reddit[0] and twitter[1].  
But those are not the exact story that I really wanted to write.
<!-- more -->

# Context

Calliope Mori, a VTuber[2], is many things.  
To me, she is an oasis of inspiration. And that's not even one of her actual characteristics; she works hard, keeps an open mind, has street smarts, and can be an incredible *incredible* softie. Her songs and lyrics are amazing! She leads by example, and she makes an enormous impact on the communities of creators by showing.  
OK, I made that last part up based on gut feeling. I don't partake in (m)any communities, but she did move atleast _me_.

# Stories

What I actually wanted to write was a longform book. Or at least 2 chapters of a story that is about the anthropomorphization of death, a humanlike reaper.  
I see a challenge in integrating the world of the living with the world beyond, dubbed the "ethereal". There must also be forbidden love, of course. _wouldn't want to write a story without a bit of fanservice_

I have no writing experience, however, and started out with random mumbo jumbo. On occasion I talked to people on Reddit and Discord to gather ideas and feedback, but most progression has been made by myself. A year has passed since.   
Given the low output, it's fair to say I didn't actively put a lot of time into the cycle of practice/feedback/repeat. The stuf I wrote without showing anyone is practically nothing[3] and without any related feedback it's irrelevant to my point.

A point of notability; These stories all have a grim/dark theme. Altough these stories are born from my imagination, I'm don't actually feel lost/lonely/suicidal. Calliope and the theme of her virtual avatar is interesting, so that's the material I'm working with.

## Grasping for the relief of death

Following is a small text in direct response to art I saw on Twitter[4] (Hi, Myxo[5]). The artstyle blew my mind, at the time.

```txt
I've lived a restless life. How couldn't I see? 
Her beauty is ethereal. What have I done?
Was the destruction I sought worth it? Her touch is gentle. Now I understand...
What I longed for was a new beginning. Guided by her hand.
```

> SPOILERS AHEAD

The text is about a troubled person who committed a heinous act. His actions have bad consequences and before his last breath he stares at the reaper herself.  
The person understands it's his time to go and hopes(!) to get taken to a better place where his starting circumstances are better. He crosses Styx peacefully.

## Heartbreak and loneliness

"... Calli... What are you doing?"

I notice my pink-haired friend trudging along the sidewalk. From the opposite side of the street I'm waving at her like a crazy person.

"...? Carrying my Groceries. What's up, Kusotori?"

Using her arms as a cradle I see she's barely holding up a few bottles of wine, vegetables, and a small bag of rice.

In my enthusiasm I sprint up to her, dodging cyclists on the way. Oof, that was a miscalculation.

She offers me her shoulder to take a breather. I shouldn't do intense activities at literally the hottest hour of the day!

"Calli, where's the bag?"

"What bag? This body has two good arms and hands. I can carry my gro.. ceries just fine!"

"You almost dropped that tho..."

"... hmph. I ain't gonna be paying no extra fee for some stinkin plastic bag."

The brutality of her sneer sent a shiver down my spine. That was sooo in character!

This must be about one of her principles, right? She mentions them sometimes at totally random moments.

"~Save money where possible!~" or was it "~Only spend money on the necessary things!~"? For real, those just sound the same to me.

She continues trotting forward and I take a second to save a mental picture of the moment. I feel my face contract with a smile.

"..."

A cold sensation constricts my throat. What should have been enthusiastic kirring at Calli was replaced with silence.

I feel my chest compressing as if I'm getting tightly hugged.

Slightly annoyed I look over my shoulder to see who pushed himself against me. Nothing...

The stir on the street, the noises from passerby cars and bicycles, all is engulfed by a pitch. black. nothingness...

But my body remains, somehow frozen in space. I became a bystander while the world sank into a dark bottomless sea.

Every fiber in my body tries to resist this forced position. So much so that my muscles start to ache, And I can't even move a finger.

The warm memories I hold dearly become overwhelmed by loneliness.

My body aches. Tears flow down my cheeks. I don't want this!

This powerlessness is nauseating. The heavy beating of my heart resonates painfully inside my head.

The last strands of Calli's hair disappear from sight. No! No! No! Calli don't leave me!

She was gulped down by the same darkness that's holding a firm grip onto my body.

Something inside me snapped...

A huge orange blaze spews like a geyser from my gut! The spectacle generates a comforting warmth.

This newfound ability is melting away the effects of the overbearing darkness.

I try to collect my thoughts. Calli is not forgetting about me, I'll make sure of it!

On my back a new fire takes form of feathery wings. They are huge, like 3 times my arm span, and beautiful!

I feel graceful. This aura, and these colors... they're somehow a little familiar.

"All I have to do is just keep moving forward" I whisper as if it was some spell incantation.

The flames burn stronger, radiating a blindingly brilliant light. I can't see anything but notice my body falling down for a second.

"..."

"... why I think this brand is better."

"..."

"... hmm?"

"..."

I blink. It doesn't look like I'm on fire.

"... Kiara..."

Hesitantly I touch my chest with my left hand. Everything certainly feels normal...

"... Oi! Kusotori!"

I looked up and turned to what made that noise, straight into Calli's eyes. She's leering back.

"Yeah! I think so too!" I responded aiming for a natural tone, while I internally scramble to remember what we were talking about. Was it about wine?

I can tell that she's not convinced. Call me a bird brain all you want but I can still tell someone's facial expression. That raised eyebrow and doubtful expression on her face is a ~dead~ giveaway.

"... uh-huh. So tell me, what brand of wine do I like again?"

Ah... shit. She just had to confirm it didn't she? I'm sure my face is now panicky.

Oh man, we've known each other for too long! Convincingly lying to her will be next to impossible ... DISTRACTION TIME!

"Uhh... H-How is that bag holding up for you now?" Oomph! Rough lift off there, Kiara. That was as smooth as sandpaper!

For a moment hey eyes grow bigger, then they frantically wander around the room.

Calli's living room is small but cozy. There is a computer desk, a two-person dining table, and some plants hanging down from the wall.

Earlier we lit and placed candles on top of the table. I find the flickering of a candle soothing. I could sit and just gaze upon a burning fire for hours.

This setup provides just enough light to see each other's faces. The remaining space is veiled in gloom.

I keep staring at Calli until she gives me her answer. Oi oi, Kiara! Maybe turn down the intensity a bit... keep it cool.

She clears her throat in an attempt to bridge the past few seconds of silence, followed by a sip from her cup of wine.

"The flower bag... You mean the bag with the flower print?"

"Yaaas! The pink one." With a playful tone I add, "It looks so cute!"

A teensy-tiny grin breaks through Calli's otherwise stern face. She might not give this impression but pushing the right buttons will sway her just like anyone else.

"Yeah, I carry it around sometimes.. you know, for groceries and stuff. It's very functional."

I snigger, "Calli!! Just.. functional!? Aren't artists supposed to avoid bland and common vocabu-vocabularary?"

With a soft voice she lets out an "Ha haah!" and grins. "You got me there, Kusotori!"

She's right about that. Our friendship started so long ago; in fact, even before my first memory.

Up until now, I cannot remember any moment when she let me down. When I'm sad, she listens. When I'm happy, we celebrate.

I bought her sooo many trinkets in return. Each and everyone is attached to a special memory we made together.

I don't think she could ever forget about me.

"Well, I do strut around the city..."

"... Calli, I don't actually want to hear any words of appraisal right now." I blurted out to intentionally interrupt her.

"I know some feelings communicate better unspoken." That felt like a really wise thing to say, I'm barely holding back my smug face.

"Maybe put those words in your next song for me!"

She thinks about it for a second, "Yeah, maybe I'll do that!"

Her phone buzzes for attention. She takes it out of her pocket single-handed while the other reaches for the cup of wine.

"If you're ever stuck for words just call me, ok? This bird brain wants to help."

I get back just a nod of agreement as her concentration was claimed by the phone. That notification must be from manager-san.

She probably wrote me off as ~the usual~ weird behavior. But this situation must be hard for her too.

I'll remember how much you mean to me. Forever and longer...

Arrgh! If only words were simpler! I'm sure you feel the same.
```

## Love letter

This text started out as an attempt at writing a Valentine's letter to Calliope. However, I got stuck on words and it turned into something unrelated to Calliope. I retained her name because it's a cool one though!  
I tried to go for Hamilton-like rhythm, I watched the musical-movie recently AND IT WAS MINDBLOWINGLY GOOD. In the end it barely works, I need to learn about rap flow and rythm because there is zero consistency.

> Watching that was a recommendation from Calliope btw. Thanks Calli!

```txt
My dearest, Calliope

Are you doing well? I'm trying to hold out some more.
I miss you! Lonely nights are so cold.
Your smile is what I hold imprinted on my brain.
People say life and death is not the same.
People say, I cannot make a claim, on you, not anymore. 
I'm tensing up ready to revolt.

Honey, I'm restless.
After all that happened, my life is now a living hell.
You're in the kitchen, in the shower, your beauty is ethereal.
But there's no point in dwelling, those thoughts are imaginary.
I wish we had one last picnic in the park, how swell.
Seeking you out, I'm not allowed.
For a choice, a reason, a law of the universe? I'll tear this fabric apart! 
And if God tries to stop me, I'll make him taste my curse!

But her touch, it's gentle. Now, I understand.
Is destruction what I sought? no.
What I longed for was a new beginning. With you guiding us by hand.
I'll keep her close, I promise. 
Tell her stories of who her real mom is, why we went to war.
Sweety, in her you live forevermore.
```

> SPOILERS AHEAD

The text is about a man losing his wife after an accident. What exactly happened is open to interpretation. You could say he married a reaper, or there was some Romeo&Juliet drama going on. Either way, their love bore fruit and his daughter depends on him for survival and education.  
This is in letterform, because these are the actual words the man is writing down as if he's sending the paper to his loved one. It's nothing more than a cry into the abyss, a way to destress, and to reevaluate his emotions and perspective on his situation. So he writes and figures out, quite a rollercoaster ride.  
That's also how my writing process works. I'm curious to know if anyone else would describe the experience the same.

# Conclusion

So it's been a year, what's the evaluation?

I conclude that I still have no clue what the hell I'm doing. My methods feel like brute-forcing.  
I lack skills in tempo and flow, and need those taught to me because that's a ceiling I feel cannot be broken on my own. I also don't put enough hours into this distraction (as in hobby) to make large meaningful progress.

I publish immediately for peace of mind. I regularly revisit my content to look for opportunities to improve.
