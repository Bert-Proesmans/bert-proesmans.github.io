# I'm a fan of Kiara Takanashi!

Alright, let's wrap up this series. I've drained my urges to write. <!-- more -->

It won't be long before this blog ends up in the depths of forgetfulness, as is tradition.  
This fan experience has been fun and intriguing, but it's coming to an end. The text you're reading now is a symbolic milestone.

## Closing thoughts

I've shown an uncool side of me. That wasn't obvious before. But many came before me, and many will follow when I'm gone. Being a fan isn't something bad, but beautiful in a way that not everyone gets it. It encompasses passion, coming from somewhere deep within, and a sense of purpose.  
This experience was the first to make me understand. I understand friends and family just a little bit better. How they felt, their experiences, and how an ass others can be while acting insensitive (myself included). Fans commit to this logically unexplainable thing by various means, but the result is all the same.  
With enough time and effort on the part of the superstar, it becomes almost a religion. People build shrines so they won't forget their superstar and those feelings once held dearly.

This series of posts is my shrine for Kiara. My writing isn't perfect, far from it actually, but it's a thing I created myself. Next to enshrining a piece of Kiara, it holds a part of me too. It's nothing special to most others, and that's the lesson.

The actual shrine is where you'd want to be. Kiara built a nice virtual spot on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsx4Hqa-1ORjQTh9TYDhww) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/takanashikiara). It's a welcoming place and decorated with a lot of fan material too! She's amazing.
