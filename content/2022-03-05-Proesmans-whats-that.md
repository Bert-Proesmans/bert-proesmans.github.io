The world is actually well connected, at least if you're using the internet. My virtual personna through which I experience internet adventures has my real name attached. It's the same name that sometimes causes funny pronounciations and confusion.
<!-- more -->
Easily mistaken for a small, confined space, the internet is actually a vast universe of content and interaction. It's ours to shape and efforts by the tech giants made that space virtually unlimited in size, with almost no restrictions on content.  
Within the communities I frequently visit there are Germans, French, Ukrainians, other fellow Europeans, Indians, Chinese, Indonesians, Japanese, Australians, Americans, Brazilians etc.

The language we commonly use for communication is a mix of British and American English. Theoretically no problem, but practically everyone is using their version of English. This leads to, of course it does, funny situations where pronounciation failed and the entire conversation gets unhinged. Like the pronounciation of [earth in this short clip](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxd83mhfgIZBjVzPiCZd7QfRcP8eTnezrF). Don't tell me you did not hear something more... enticing.

Jump over the yada-yada to [hear some clips](#butchering-but-not-really)!

# Proesmans

Proesmans ([prˈusmɑns](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=pr%CB%88usm%C9%91ns&voice=Ruben)), my last name, is a bit hard to use internationally. It has 2 uncommon sounds that make it tough to pronounce in languages other than Flemish (Dutch)

TODO

## Alveolar trill

Rrrrrrrolling R! There are cultures who use them, others do not. It's a bit hard to get the sound quite right without training.

It's also quite difficult to send the letter through a telephone line. Due to compression an R is sometimes muffled. That's a bit annoying since there is no context for the receiving party to reconstruct the right letter.

TODO

## Close back rounded vowel

F**oo**d

TODO

## Butchering, but not really

I have some clips where people try pronouncing my name. The attempts are actually not bad, almost exactly right, depending on the person. I'm well aware that it takes practice, that's why I decided to change my name a little bit.

So meet my new alter ego;

> NOTE; Wikipedia tells me that a Pretzel is originally named "Brezel". Pretzel is an americanization, which surprised me because I literally live a 60 minute drive away from a medium/large German city. Yet, I also use the word Pretzel.
