Weird phrasing agreed. I picked this up while watching a certain [Youtube content creator](https://youtu.be/i7C6-fZlNXs?t=6433). The words mean nothing on their own. For some reason, they keep ringing in my head. <!-- more -->
In this post, I'm piecing together a meaning. For the ~~glory of satan~~ sake of my sanity, of course.

# Skeet & Yeet

Ok, the introductory text isn't 100% correct. 'Skeet and yeet' or 'Yeet and skeet' exist in meme-culture. Their meaning isn't safe for work.
I'll use the ampersand (&) to distinguish between both the meme form and my own.

# Scoot the doot
