# I'm a fan of Kiara Takanashi!

I'm a serious fan of [Kiara Takanashi](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Takanashi_Kiara) since December last year.  
She's a hard-working video content creator with a digital avatar and a warm and generally ecstatic personality. She's amazing because she thinks fondly of her fans and actively seeks out interactions whenever she's online and offline. She's also trilingual, sings, draws, can (supposedly) fly, and is an absolute delight to spend time with.  
Her character and history is built around the mythical creature, a Phoenix. It's considered bad intent to openly spread information about the physical persona behind the avatar!

Before this experience I couldn't even comprehend what being a "fan" actually means. This post contains the result of some digging into my behavior. I intend to shine a positive light on the phenomenon.  
As a bonus, future nitwits like myself might have found an interesting read.

## Fans and their environment

I remember my niece being a serious fan of [One Direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction), and another friend fawning over [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift). In theory, there is nothing wrong with this behavior, everyone is entitled to experience an enjoyable time. Those are perfect to offset the guaranteed pushbacks you'll encounter within your lifespan.

A balanced mental state leads to stable connections with your body and environment. It's not uncommon for mentally unstable people to suffer from health issues or getting involved with fights with romantic partners, or work relations, or neighbors.  
To be clear; Aspects of life can be represented like a weight scale. Each of us is in charge of keeping the needle under control. **This balance is not always bound to the duality of our math or religion!** or differently put, this scale has more than two plates that hold weights. Our decisions typically lead to a concise yes/no answer, but these answers are often not satisfactory. We feel that more kinds of weights need to be thrown on the scale.  
"Does not liking brocolli mean you absolutely hate eating it?" asks yourself this question and discover for yourself how black/white your view on life is.

> The needle needs to stay under 'control' and not 'in the middle/centered' because those are different things. There are perfectly valid reasons to rotate the needle into an extreme state. Recognizing such a situation comes with what old people call 'life experience' (I think).

Being a fan triggers exaggerated behavior in one of many possible ways, often confused with addiction. The bottom line is this behavior will look uncommon to other people.
External opinions about extremes rapidly dwell into the negative space. That's imperatively confirmed to be true; use politics as a topic or look at the reasons for success for Facebook and Twitter.  
These opinions often stem from misunderstanding or a counter-reaction to perceived obsession(s). Fans specifically can get laughed at, or get excluded from conversations, or become the target of active bullying. All those community reactions prevent them from sharing their excitement. This hurts the self-image of most of them. Humans are group animals after all.

There are fans that pull through, notwithstanding the bullying they receive because of it. This requires a lot of willpower and I have all respect for this skill. I believe Kiara is an example of such a fan.  
However, this is not laudable behavior because the long-term causes become a coin-flip good or bad. In any case, the chances are high to end up as a troubled person, which results in a smaller compatibility window with other people.

> "Troubled person" comes from my lack of vocabulary. I don't intend this to be read as a negative trait. Having experienced certain feelings and human interactions changes your mentality. If those experiences and perspectives are rather unique your personality becomes hard to fathom by the average person. This affects new and longstanding interpersonal relations.  
Simply put into an analogy; At which point do you cross the line between normal human and superstar?

These fan relations are legitimate, at least one in ten people (source; my own pool of acquaintances) will turn into a serious fan about something once in their life. I think the chances of finding a serious fan around the same age about the same topic is very small. The internet helps to find them, a good thing yay!, but you need to expose yourself for the entire world to see before you can get something out of it. At this point, I circled back to an earlier statement about external opinions.  
Be aware that the internet is generally not much different from the living space within your hometown. On the plus side, using it gives you a better chance at finding like-minded fans or at least understanding people.

## Fans and their balance

Each week I spend about 20 hours of my time consuming Kiara's content. Yes, that's the equivalent of a part-time job. Some weeks the average is a bit higher, but never actually lower. Eighteen weeks have passed since December 2020, resulting in 360 hours invested.  
This total excludes the amount of time I invested to create fan works and also the time I spent thinking about the topic in general.

Are these too many hours spent? I'm uncertain, the result is inconclusive.  
There was a moment, around two weeks ago, where I decided to hard quit. My day consisted of sleep, work, eat, work out, and Kiara. I felt chained, stuck in a non-productive (outside of work) mentality. Normally I consume a lot of science news and do 'programming for fun' within my spare time. Up to this day of writing (2021-05-13) I'm feeling more tired and less motivated than before. BUT writing this post is goes pretty well! Maybe I just needed to do something else.  
I do not think the time I already invested could have been spent better on other stuff.

I've donated a total of 86 euros to Kiara since December 2020. That's about 5 euros per week or 23 euro cents per hour of consumed content.

Is this too much money spent? No, I'm convinced that this is very cheap for the amount of amusement I got in return.  
I'm a bit surprised though because I expected the amount to be around 50 euros.  
I love Kiara's transparent policy about donations. She's a creator focused on interaction, the monetary aspect is secondary:
* People can consume 99% of her content for free! 
* She has a single membership plan for 5 euro's per month that provide visual perks
* Alternatively, you can send her a SuperChat, which is a highlighted chat message, for any amount of your choosing.  
She gives your name a shout-out and sometimes reads your message out loud with a reply.

> On a slight tangent; The daily cost of my car is something that's been on my mind for a week by now. The cost scale doesn't even compare, caused by the ultra-low amount of time I actually use the car, and I don't even like driving that much. A car costs me an absurd amount of money more than Kiara.

## Fans and their trigger
