The animation film A Silent Voice (Koe no Katachi), released in 2016 in Japan, became an arguably bit hit when it featured at western world cinema's in 2017. It also happens to be one of my favourite animation films, and I'll explain why.

# Plot

The films plot is about teenager Shoya struggling with the consequences of his actions as a kid. He bullied classmate Shoko, who happens to be deaf, by having his behaviour spiraling out of control because of boundary pushing and a spiral of reinforcement from classmates. Simply put; they were just kids going off each other's behaviour, without an adult stepping in. As if karma kicked in he got scapegoated and bullied himself, becoming a socially inept person. He turned into himself, secluded from everyone except his mom. It leads to him seriously considering suicide, convinced that taking all sins with him into the grave will unburden his family and society as a whole.  
As a teenager, he decides to tie up loose ends by apologizing to Shoko and returning her notebook. He meets her and realizes that she wanted, since they were young, to be friends. He goes along with that tought, thinking he'll be able to atone for his bullying in the past.  
The story involves his former classmates and how they are all shaped by the shared experiences. Their memories don't perfectly line up; they each have a different interpretation of the problems, different views on who was victim and who was perpetrator.  
You'll see that the circle of reinforced behaviour happens again. As long as they do not accept what happened and honestly communicate what's on their mind they'll remain unhappy. They struggle, like most teenagers do, and again no one is there to break the spiral.  
Those events culminate in another suicide attempt. This time basically right before the eyes of everyone involved. This event makes them evaluate the important things in their lives. The collective group mentality changes for the better, appreciating what they have at that point. That positive thinking becomes the basis for accepting who they are, not necesarilly fix themselves, and look out for a happy future.

> People driven to suicide are typically scapegoated, carrying their own and others sins. I just realized that's basically a crucifiction complex.  
> In the bible there exists this axiom that humanity is beyond saving, so Jezus was crucified, and died for our sins. His death is represented as simple as pushing a button. Except that's not the entire story! Jezus lived about 30 years before his death, trying to guide humanity to better themselves. He kept working towards his goal for a lifetime, before pulling out his ultimate skill; revival.  
> Please don't focus on that one thing, the crucification of Jezus, and misinterpret its meaning. Please don't think suicide will erase all sins you bear. Humans don't revive, suicide only leads to the permanent erasure of your future. Thinking like that saddens me.

# The best

On a related note, another highly popular animation film released around the same time; Your Name (Kimi no Na wa). Its director, and writer too, Makoto Shinkai, had already proven himself several years back by directing 5 Centimeters per Second (2007) and The Garden of Words (2013). Nowadays each of his featured films seem to be a success, and recognized by the entire animation community.  
Shinkai films are visually impecable; very lifelike and meticulously detailed keyframes, high quality animation, whimsical stories and emotional songs on the soundtrack. The stories are based on Japanese traditions/folklore but original and realistically portrait. Some have magical elements that break engagement, but judging from his last performance he's trying to tie those into the concept of creative expressivity. I shouldn't repeat that animation has the advantage of not being subjected to the constraints of our physical world.

So why is Koe no Katachi my favourite movie, even though it's contending with a perfect combination of everything neatly packed inside a 2 hour feature film? You won't like this answer, because I bend the rules for my answer.  
The reason why is difficult to explain. It's a personal feeling.

- How do you rate a film that has polished details like never seen before?
- Is it even fair to rate an instant classic?
- Why do I feel emptiness thinking about rating something perfect?

Comparing Shinkai's films with any other feels like apples to oranges.
