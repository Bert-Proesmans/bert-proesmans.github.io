Who **is** Bert-Proesmans?!

### Personal

* My name is Bert Proesmans, no surprise there,

* A student living in Belgium with a massive writer's block,

* Loves to program stuff,

* Loves to think long and hard about dilemma's and about approaching the [Golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)) in almost everything.

### Education

After primary school I decided to attend high school in the next city to extend my formerly close to home boundaries.  
My field of study in high school was science, after practising Latin for two years. During the final two years I specialized my field of study towards mathematics.

The next step was going to university and I chose [Hasselt University](https://www.uhasselt.be/en). From then until present my field of study is computer science.  
Currently I'm taking courses which are part of the last year of my Master's degree. So far my trajectory went without bumps except delivering a bachelor's thesis (remember the writer's block?).

I expect to graduate in 2019.
