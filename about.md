Who **is** Bert-Proesmans?!

### Personal

* My name is Bert Proesmans, no surprise there,

* A student living in Belgium with a massive writer's block,

* Loves to program stuff,

* Loves to think long and hard about dilemma's and about approaching the [Golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)) in almost everything.

* Online aliases: [Bert-Proesmans](https://github.com/Bert-Proesmans), BertP

### Education

After primary school I decided to attend high school in the next city to extend my formerly close to home boundaries.  
My field of study in high school was science, after practising Latin for two years. During the final two years I specialized my field of study towards mathematics.

The next step was going to university and I chose [Hasselt University](https://www.uhasselt.be/en). From then until present my field of study is computer science.  
Currently I'm taking courses which are part of the last year of my Master's degree. So far my trajectory went without bumps except delivering a bachelor's thesis (remember the writer's block?).

I expect to graduate in 2019.

* 2006-2013: [High school] Viio Humaniora - Science+Mathematics

* 2013-2016: [University] UHasselt - Bachelor computer science

* 2016-Present: [University] UHasselt - Master computer science

### Computer science related projects

In general my programming activity is tracked by Github and publicly available. Though there are several projects worth mentioning listed below.

* Robot simulator [Java] - closed source @university  
    Project built with the purpose of properly planning coding efforts and cooperating with team members (2 people).  
    The end product is a (2D, top-down) visual simulator of robots interacting with their environment. The robots were
    programmable by writing Lua and interacting with our exposed API.

* Shift scheduler [Java-Python] - closed source @university  
    Project built with the purpose of properly planning coding efforts and cooperating with team members (6 people).  
    The end product is a platform comprised of 2 systems, built to be usable by youth movements, student clubs and businesses;
    
    1. Website for managing associated people, their shift schedules, availability, preferences and customizable weights to tune
    the scheduler,
    
    2. Back-end system generating schedules which measure up to the expectations of as many associated people within provided 
    constraints
     
 * Various public (and private) projects for the [HearthSim community](https://hearthsim.info/)  
     HearthStone related projects.
