This website has been up for a long time and it still attracts readers from across the globe. Why or how is beyond me, but it's certain that some updates are required.

The last update happened in December 2018 which moved the website to my own domain. The last content update was made in early 2018. Man, that's already a long time ago!  
I'm for sure not a student anymore, hehe.

At this point in time I updated the [about-page]({% link /about.md %}), website title and some configuration. I'm still in awe of how fast pages of this website load, that's nice!  
At some point in the future, I'd like to do an update to the site design but I hate web technologies. So expect nothing unless some miracle happens.
