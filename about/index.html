        <p>Who <strong>is</strong> Bert-Proesmans?!</p>
<p>TLDR; I’m a computer guy. The actual answer consists of more words, but I try to keep it light.</p>
<h3 id="quickies">Quickies</h3>

<li>
<p>Occasionally wastes a lot of energy thinking long and hard about dilemmas and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)">Golden mean</a> in nature and man-made constructs.</p>

<h3 id="long-answer">Long answer</h3>
<p>Without going too far back into the events that made me who I am today, the period where I built out the biggest part of my personality was between age 17 and age 20. I’ll always look back at this timespan as getting #woke (old meme by now, I know). To properly contextualize me at the start of this period of my life;</p>
<ol>
<li>I’ve had the luxury of smart and caring parents (thanks mom and dad!) and close family,</li>
<li>I was supported, and encouraged to take on any challenge on my path,</li>
<li>For a long time I’ve lived kind of selfishly, not caring about other people and their feelings,</li>
<li>What is a setback, I’ve never encountered that before?</li>
</ol>
<p>In those three years since age 17, I failed to successfully transition to the next year of high school. I had a one-year do-over, which was certainly painful for a while. In hindsight, this wasn’t that bad because <strong>I felt the importance of a good understanding of basic education</strong>.. and <strong>made more friends</strong> on the way. I got my degree one year late.</p>
<p>I started university, where I quickly realized that <strong>flukes are not a normal thing</strong>. There were certainly walls I ran into but being surrounded by smarter people made me push myself to climb them. This wasn’t always a solo effort, and I thank every one of my teammates for their rigor. I learned that <strong>respect for each other is a basic necessity</strong> because without it no type of relationship lasts… especially when those people have not perfectly aligned values. To this day I still <strong>prefer being surrounded by smarter people</strong>!<br />
There were also sad moments; people falling off or losing interest. It felt like my year do-over but worse because now I was the guy progressing on our trajectory and others were stumbling.</p>
<p>Years in a university are short, you meet new people and never see them again very quickly. Other than that you’re forced to do your own time-management, decide your own workload, and <em>develop yourself</em>. This is a period where I was privileged to float in between responsibilities without consequences.<br />
And <strong>I enjoyed this responsibility-free life very much</strong>, even though it was partly detrimental to my being. A summary would be; <em>I got fat behind my computer</em>.<br />
It was a fun time, I look back to all of my school days with joy. I understood very well how luxurious that time was, and now it’s hard to rehab from that way of living.</p>
<p>I tried to put a part of me into the above text, but I doubt it communicates well enough. I do remember taking a personality test in 2020 which, in my opinion, should better transcribe my reasoning. Apparently, personality changes over time, so the link is date stamped for reference, see below.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>I’ve always been studying sciences on top of basic mathematics and language skills. I’m fairly confident in my Dutch and English, but my French and German are at a below-average level.<br />
At university, I chose Computer Science to prepare for a potential career in software/hardware development or any of their derivations. One of the most surprising things I learned is that all science domains cross-pollinate, so my science background proved useful.
I’ve had the pleasure to work with passionate people who taught me advanced topics in their respective fields. Outside of school, over the internet by example, I managed to pick up interesting bits of knowledge through the same means.</p>
<p>Important to note is that I didn’t finish any higher degree. To quit school and start working is actually one of the few actively deliberate choices I made in my life.<br />
I certainly don’t regret that decision, other than that there isn’t much else to mention.</p>

<h3 id="programming-projects">Programming projects</h3>
<p>My personal programming activity is tracked by Github and publicly available. My professional coding is conducted within private employer boundaries.<br />
Some highlights below;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protobuffer decompiler [C#] - open source @<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hearthsim.info/">HearthSim community</a><br />
Decompiles specific protobuffer schema’s from binaries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private servers and protocol investigation tools - closed source @<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hearthsim.info/">HearthSim community</a><br />
HearthStone related stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shift scheduler [Java-Python] - closed source @university<br />
Project built with the purpose of properly planning coding efforts and cooperating with team members (6 people).<br />
The end product is a platform comprised of 2 systems, built to be usable by youth movements, student clubs and businesses;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Website for managing associated people, their shift schedules, availability, preferences and customizable weights to tune
the scheduler,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back-end system generating schedules which measure up to the expectations of as many associated people within provided
constraints</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wire connection overview - closed source @<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.europowergenerators.com">Europower Generators bv</a><br />
A Solidworks Electrical drawing data processor that outputs wire connections in a table. The order and direction of wires is optimized to simplify production preparations (eg wire cutting in bulk) and the actual connecting work.<br />
Output is used in tandem with Single-line diagrams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robot simulator [Java] - closed source @university<br />
A project built with the purpose of properly planning coding efforts and cooperating with team members (2 people).<br />
The end product is a (2D, top-down) visual simulator of robots interacting with their environment. The robots were
programmable by writing Lua and interacting with our exposed API.</p>
